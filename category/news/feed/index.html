										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has entered its second year, resulting in global conditions in an extensive crisis, degrading all aspects of human life, particularly on health; economic; social; cultural; and tourism sectors. Inevitably, all aspects of global life have been radically disrupted.</p>
<p>In such conditions, Indonesia as a big, strong nation that has the spirit to continue to grow, must be able to survive with various attempts. Therefore, all elements and components of the nation are very important to unite hearts, draw closer to the Almighty, ask for His wisdom that the pandemic will end soon and the world condition becomes better.</p>
<p>One of the efforts to bring good values is to create positive momentum, relying on the value of cultural wisdom, such as a cultural practice of some Javanese people by drawing the symbol of Ceplok Mangkoro. <strong>C</strong><strong>eplok</strong><strong> Mangkoro</strong><strong> Motif</strong> comes from the backside of the headdress or “<em>sumping</em>” of the Javanese wayang epic costume. “<em>Mangkara</em><em>”</em> comes from the sentence “<strong><em>ora ana sekara-kara</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong> which means <strong>“</strong><strong>there are no obstacles</strong><strong>”</strong>. Drawing the Ceplok Mangkoro symbol (in painting or batik) is an expression of hope and prayers which means to prevent mischance or disaster.</p>
<p>This positive momentum of cultural practices and prayers will be held together with the Jogja International Batik Biennale (JIBB) in October 2021, coinciding with the World Batik Day. Yogyakarta, which is recognized as the World Batik City, initiates the momentum to express prayers and cultural rituals through drawing the Ceplok Mangkoro batik motif, sending a message of unity and prayers for the world peace and safety. This activity is entitled <strong>JOGJA MEMBATIK DUNIA (JOGJA</strong> <strong>BATIKS THE WORLD)</strong>.</p>

<p>In this cultural event, it is hoped that the President of the Republic of Indonesia, Mr. Joko Widodo, along with influential figures from various countries in the world, could draw the Ceplok Mangkoro motif. Several influential figures who are expected to be willing to support the batik movement with President Joko Widodo and First Lady Iriana Joko Widodo are:</p>
<ul>

					<description><![CDATA[One of the cultural products that has a specific, original and cultural identity is the cultural art of &#8220;batik.&#8221; Batik is an Indonesian cultural work art<span class="excerpt-hellip"> […]</span>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the cultural products that has a specific, original and cultural identity is the cultural art of &#8220;batik.&#8221; Batik is an Indonesian cultural work art admired by the world. Indonesian Batik got recognition from UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity in 2009. In addition, adding more credit to this recognition, Yogyakarta was named as the World Batik City by WCC (World Craft Council) in 2014.</p>
<p>In order to support the existence of Yogyakarta as the World Batik City, various activities have been carried out by the government of the Special Region of Yogyakarta. One of the events held is JIBB which has been started in 2016 and continued in 2018. This year, JIBB 2021 is held with the theme: &#8220;BORDERLESS BATIK &#8211; the sub theme: From HERITAGE to MILLENNIAL&#8217;S LIFESTYLE&#8221;. This theme implies that &#8220;Batik Art&#8221; in the modern era ideally can be developed across the boundaries of space and time and able to adapt to the current times and the latest technology. Basically, batik art can also be developed flexibly in responding to various formal limitations such as; Time (Period), Tools/Equipment Forms, Final Function, Patterns/Motifs/Decoration, and Methods/Technical Applications. This flexibility allows batik to develop more broadly and dynamically but still stays wisely, in the sense that it does not leave its basic principles.</p>
<p>The sub-theme of JIBB 2021 means the art of batik cannot be defined as only tradition. However, it must be able to overcome the challenges in the &#8220;Era of Disruption&#8221; as it is today. Therefore, batik art is expected to reach millennials as the future generation who have full of innovative and creative ideas. This generation will preserve batik and capably develop it with a touch of up to date renewal. Batik, which is well known to the world as the Indonesian cultural heritage, is greatly hoped to play a role in driving the economy of the community. Especially if batik can be packaged and managed properly, it will bring broad and positive impact, particularly for the welfare of the community (artist craftsmen) and the economy of the Indonesian nation. Broadly speaking, the theme of JIBB 2021 displays several of the 7 WCC criteria for the World Batik City, namely  “Economic Value, International Reputation and Conservation efforts through regeneration”.</p>

<p>In order to gain engagement from the world community as wide as possible,  JIBB 2021 will hold an international online seminar (Webinar) with the same theme, namely: &#8220;From HERITAGE to MILLENNIAL&#8217;S LIFE STYLE&#8221; and the sub-theme &#8220;Batik Marketability, Internationality and Sustainability for Millennial Generation Lifestyle.”</p>
<p>The webinar is planned to be held on October 18, 2021 from 08.30 until 12.30 WIT at Ambarukmo Palace Hotel, Jl. Solo Yogyakarta (tentative).</p>
<p>As the keynote speaker, this webinar will be opened by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia, Mrs. Retno Marsudi, who raised the topic of International Trade and Investment of batik sector from Marketability aspect &#8211; (Economic Value), Internationality aspect &#8211; (Global Value), and Sustainability aspect &#8211; (Consistency Value).</p>
<p>The webinar is planned to be presented by three speakers with the following sub-themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Textile applications with traditional nuances, especially batik in the Fashion trend for millennials (Gen Y &amp; Z).</li>
<li>Export strategy into foreign market for handicraft products from Indonesia, especially batik art.</li>
<li>Sustainability of batik for the Millennial Life Style in terms of technical aspects, themes and development.</li>
</ul>
<p>The implementation of this Webinar has a practical purpose to explore stakeholder policies and thoughts and to elaborate the results of R&amp;D (Research and Development) as well as to get the best practices from key notes and domestic or foreign speakers for the existence of Yogyakarta batik in the scope of: Marketability (Economic Value), Internationality ( Global Value), Sustainability (Consistency Value) in the dimensions of preservation, development, empowerment of batik art as a cultural heritage (characteristic heritage of Yogyakarta). The ultimate goal of organizing this event is that the image of Yogyakarta as a World Batik City will be broadly recognized, and more people will know, love and be proud to wear Indonesian batik.</p>
